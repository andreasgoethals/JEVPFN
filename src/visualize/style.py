"""THE shared style. One place, every notebook in THIS project.

MOSTLY EMPTY ON PURPOSE. What the template fixes is the part that follows from the output medium:
**every figure ends up in a scientific paper printed on A4**, so it is drawn at the width it will
occupy on the page and its text is sized to be readable there. That is the same in every project,
so it is filled in below.

WHAT THIS PROJECT FILLS IN is the *look*: the colours, the grid, the spines, the marker shapes.
Two projects plotting different things have no reason to look alike, so the template does not
pretend otherwise — the requirement is only that **every notebook inside one project shares one
style**, defined here and nowhere else. A notebook never picks a colour or a size itself; if it
needs a new one, it gets added here, once, and every figure gains it at the same time. (If a new
project is close to an existing one, copying that project's `style.py` is the fastest start.)

Call `apply()` once at the top of every notebook.

# FIGURE SIZES — A4, and nothing else.
#
# A4 is 210 x 297 mm. With 25 mm margins that leaves a 160 x 247 mm text block, and the numbers
# below are that block in inches.
#
# DRAW AT FINAL WIDTH, and never rescale a figure in the document. Rescaling carries the text with
# it: 9pt squeezed to 70% arrives as 6.3pt, under the ~7pt floor where small print stops being
# legible on paper. So the point sizes in `_RC` are the point sizes ON THE PRINTED PAGE.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

WIDTH_FULL = 6.30   # 160 mm — the full A4 text width
WIDTH_HALF = 3.05   # two side by side, with a ~5 mm gutter
WIDTH_THIRD = 1.95  # three side by side. Label sparingly at this width.

#: The A4 text block is 247 mm tall, but a figure taking all of it leaves no room for its caption
#: and pushes every surrounding paragraph onto another page. Half a page is the practical ceiling,
#: and `figsize` clamps to it rather than letting a tall panel grid silently overflow.
MAX_HEIGHT = 4.80   # 122 mm

GOLDEN = 0.618      # height = width * GOLDEN, unless the data wants otherwise

#: a cluster-drawn figure differ from the local one for no visible reason.

# Colours, grid, spines, line widths, marker shapes, colormaps: whatever this project's figures

#     somewhere else, the legend has to be read twice.
